CLIENT FUNCTIONS:

GetAvailableFiles()
// Gets a list, (in vector form?) of filenames available for the client to download
// These filenames should be in string format, and will be used by the GUI

RequestFile(string filename, string destPath)
//Sends one filename to the server that is chosen by the client from the list earlier recieved
//The server will need to convert this filename into a full path to the file, and use that
//full path to start the sending process like we already have working.
//"destPath" will be used as the destination path for where the file should be stored client-side
//(including the new name of the file)
